# cudaSoft
Soft particle simulator for molecular dynamics and energy minimization, written in CUDA and C++.
Current version includes:
- 2D and 3D particles in periodic boundary or fixed boundary conditions with isotropic geometry
- Molecular dynamics in the NVE and NVT ensembles
- Interaction potentials: harmonic, Lennard-Jones potential
- Active brownian model for self-propulsion

Here is a video of self-propelled particles forming and dissolving clusters (active droplets).

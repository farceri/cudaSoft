# cudaSoft
Soft particle simulator for molecular dynamics and energy minimization, written in CUDA and C++

Current version includes:
- 2D and 3D particles in Lees-Edwards, fixed and periodic boundary conditions
- Molecular dynamics in the NVE and NVT ensembles
- Interaction potentials: harmonic, Lennard-Jones potential
- Active brownian model for self-propulsion
